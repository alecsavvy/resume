- Event-driven architecture and message-based workflows

- Production infrastructure and DevOps across centralized cloud and
  decentralized validator networks

**Experience**

**Audius**\
*Senior Software Engineer* Jan. 2023 -- Dec. 2025

[**Audius Protocol**](https://github.com/AudiusProject/apps)

- Designed and released a typescript-based plugin system for the Audius
  Protocol (Pedalboard)

- Moved high-throughput write and play paths off Solana into an in-house
  Layer 1, reducing RPC load and improving throughput

- Decreased on-call events from weekly to quarterly by moving to the
  OpenAudio Protocol

[**OpenAudio Protocol**](https://github.com/OpenAudio/go-openaudio)

- Prototyped, implemented, and released the first Layer 1 protocol for
  music distribution and interoperability

- Used CometBFT for consensus, PostgreSQL for metadata storage, and
  gRPC/ConnectRPC for node APIs

- Open-sourced and maintained validator, block explorer, and schema
  repositories

- Migrated the Audius Protocol to OpenAudio with zero downtime and no
  user-facing disruption

- Worked with the executives at Audius to release the OpenAudio
  [brand](https://openaudio.org) and
  [community](https://twitter.com/OpenAudioProto)

- Built backend services for creator tokens using Akka, PostgreSQL,
  MongoDB, and Kafka

- Integrated with live Twitch event streams to power real-time games,
  leaderboards, and viewer rewards

- Developed a Twitch extension and bot for viewers to interact with the
  platform and earn rewards

**Forte.io**

- Developed blockchain tooling for game economies and external partner
  integrations using Rust, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, OpenEthereum(Parity),

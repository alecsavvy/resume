- Prototyped, implemented, and released the first Layer 1 protocol for
  music distribution and interoperability

- Used CometBFT for consensus, PostgreSQL for metadata storage, and
  gRPC/ConnectRPC for node APIs

- Open-sourced and maintained validator, block explorer, and schema
  repositories

- Migrated the Audius Protocol to OpenAudio with zero downtime and no
  user-facing disruption

- Worked with the executives at Audius to release the OpenAudio
  [brand](https://openaudio.org) and
